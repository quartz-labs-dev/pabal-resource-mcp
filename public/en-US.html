<p>
  Managing ASO (App Store Optimization) data for multiple apps across different
  stores has always been a tedious task. I needed a way to streamline this
  process, so I decided to build Pabal.
</p>

<img src="./images/pabal-web.png" alt="Pabal ASO management tool interface" />

<p>
  Pabal started as a simple idea: make ASO management easier. Instead of
  manually updating metadata across App Store Connect and Google Play Console, I
  wanted a unified workflow that could handle both platforms.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Working with multiple apps means dealing with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different metadata formats for each store</li>
  <li>Manual copy-paste between platforms</li>
  <li>Version control for ASO content</li>
  <li>Localization management across languages</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This process was time-consuming and error-prone. I needed a better solution.
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>
  Pabal provides a unified interface to manage ASO data. It converts between
  store-specific formats and a common structure, making it easy to maintain
  content across platforms.
</p>

<p>
  The tool supports pulling data from stores, converting it to a structured
  format, and pushing updates back. This workflow significantly reduces the time
  spent on ASO management.
</p>

<h2>Pabal</h2>

<p>
  Building Pabal taught me a lot about working with different APIs and data
  formats. The challenge wasn't just in the code, but in understanding how each
  store handles metadata differently.
</p>

<p>
  Now, Pabal helps me manage ASO data more efficiently. It's a simple tool, but
  it solves a real problem I face every day.
</p>

<p>Sometimes the best tools are the ones you build for yourself.</p>
